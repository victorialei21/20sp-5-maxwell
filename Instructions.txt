Welcome to Maxwell's Demon! 

In order to start the program, you will need MaxwellGame.java, MenuPanel.java, and GamePanel.java, as each file plays an important role in setting up the game. To run the game, you only need to run MaxwellGame.java, since it contains main(). 

Both the left and right chambers start off empty in the beginning. To start play, you must press the "Add More Particles" button, which will add a blue and a red particle to each side of the screen, for a total of four particles initially. If you want more of a challenge, you can add more particles using the "Add More Particles button," which will again add a blue and a red particle to each chamber. You can press this button however many times you'd like. 

The goal of the game is to separate the particles based on speed/color, so all blue/slow-moving particles should end up in the one chamber while all red/fast-moving particles should end up in the other chamber. To allow particles to move from one side to the other, simply press your mouse and the neon green door will open. To close the door again, release your mouse. 

The two displays at the top of each side show the temperature of each chamber, which is measured in degrees Maximus. Blue particles have a temperature of 12 degrees while red particles have a temperature of 96 degrees. Therefore, one side should end with a temperature of 96 and the other with a temperature of 12 degrees in order to win.

Enjoy the game!
